# Solosax website development
## Brief overview
Andrew Taylor is a wedding saxophonist. He has a website (www.solosax.co.uk) but feels that it is dated. Also the website is not mobile responsive and difficult to navigate on smaller devices. My remit was to build a clean modern responsive website that flows and feels spacious.
